##Design Patterns

### Creational patterns 
provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

### Structural patterns 
explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.

### Behavioral patterns 
take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

Advantage of design pattern:
1. They are reusable in multiple projects.
2. They provide the solutions that help to define the system architecture.
3. They capture the software engineering experiences.
4. They provide transparency to the design of an application.
5. They are well-proved and testified solutions since they have been built upon the knowledge and experience of expert software developers.
6. Design patterns don?t guarantee an absolute solution to a problem. They provide clarity to the system architecture and the possibility of building a better system.
