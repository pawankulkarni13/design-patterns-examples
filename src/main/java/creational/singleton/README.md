### Singleton Design Pattern

Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created. This class provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.

All implementations of the Singleton have these two steps in common:

Make the default constructor private, to prevent other objects from using the new operator with the Singleton class.
Create a static creation method that acts as a constructor. Under the hood, this method calls the private constructor to create an object and saves it in a static field. All following calls to this method return the cached object.
If your code has access to the Singleton class, then it’s able to call the Singleton’s static method. So whenever that method is called, the same object is always returned.

    Real-life Problem : The government is an excellent example of the Singleton pattern. A country can have only one official government. Regardless of the personal identities of the individuals who form governments, the title, “The Government of X”, is a global point of access that identifies the group of people in charge.
                    
Use the Singleton pattern when a class in your program should have just a single instance available to all clients; for example, a single database object shared by different parts of the program.

The Singleton pattern disables all other means of creating objects of a class except for the special creation method. This method either creates a new object or returns an existing one if it has already been created.
Use the Singleton pattern when you need stricter control over global variables.
Unlike global variables, the Singleton pattern guarantees that there’s just one instance of a class. Nothing, except for the Singleton class itself, can replace the cached instance.

Note that you can always adjust this limitation and allow creating any number of Singleton instances. The only piece of code that needs changing is the body of the getInstance method.

Pros
- You can be sure that a class has only a single instance.
- You gain a global access point to that instance.
- The singleton object is initialized only when it’s requested for the first time.

Cons
- Violates the Single Responsibility Principle. The pattern solves two problems at the time.
- The Singleton pattern can mask bad design, for instance, when the components of the program know too much about each other.
- The pattern requires special treatment in a multithreaded environment so that multiple threads won’t create a singleton object several times.
- It may be difficult to unit test the client code of the Singleton because many test frameworks rely on inheritance when producing mock objects. Since the constructor of the singleton class is private and overriding static methods is impossible in most languages, you will need to think of a creative way to mock the singleton. Or just don’t write the tests. Or don’t use the Singleton pattern.

    Usage examples: A lot of developers consider the Singleton pattern an antipattern. That’s why its usage is on the decline in Java code.

    Identification: Singleton can be recognized by a static creation method, which returns the same cached object.
