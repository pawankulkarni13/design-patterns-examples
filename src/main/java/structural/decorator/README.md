### Decorator Design pattern.

Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

Decorator patterns allow a user to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure. So, there is no change to the original class.
The decorator design pattern is a structural pattern, which provides a wrapper to the existing class.
Decorator design pattern uses abstract classes or interfaces with the composition to implement the wrapper.
Decorator design patterns create decorator classes, which wrap the original class and supply additional functionality by keeping the class methodsâ€™ signature unchanged.
Decorator design patterns are most frequently used for applying single responsibility principles since we divide the functionality into classes with unique areas of concern.
The decorator design pattern is structurally almost like the chain of responsibility pattern.

This pattern creates a decorator class which wraps the original class and provides additional functionality keeping class methods signature intact.
